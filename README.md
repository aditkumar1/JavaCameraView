# JavaCameraView
A sample Java application using Swing GUI to display camera feed on JFrame.
This project uses openCv library which will be auto imported using Maven.
This application captures frames continously from system's default camera and display it on JPanel.
I have tried to modularize the project as much as possible for easy understandability.
Use IntelliJIdea to avoid bugs.
